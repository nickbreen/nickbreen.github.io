I re-discovered an ancient (2011) [TF101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus_Eee_Pad_Transformer_TF101) in a cupboard. 
It's an NVIDIA Tegra 2 Android tablet with a physical keyboard dock.

It is long since EoL'd and its Android firmware is old enough to be unusable (at least due to ancient TLS/SSL support).

I had successfully used [TWRP](https://twrp.me/asus/asustransformerTF101.html) and flashed various other Android ROM's
some years ago. I thought it'd be a gas to revive it.

It has community support for [postmarketOS](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/ASUS_Eee_Pad_Transformer_(asus-tf101)) 
though I failed to boot it, and as the guide says:

> Make sure you backup your data before continuing. Note also that you won't be able to boot Android back easily.

Indeed.

So, after failing to install postmarketOS and bricking it, restoring it to stock firmware was the name of the game.
This is where a backup would have been useful: in particular the original partition table. Also, this device is old
enough that almost every forum post's or similar page's links are long-stale and those that work have versions of 
`wheelie` and `nvflash` bundled with them old enough that they just don't run anymore (think 32-bit ELF binaries built
for Ubuntu 12.04).

Fortunately there are enough pages available to cobble together the tooling:

- `nvflash` is available from NVIDIA from their [Linux 4 Tegra](https://developer.nvidia.com/linux-tegra-rel-16) (L4T) project.
  Specifically (for the TF101) the [_Ventana_ Driver Package](http://developer.download.nvidia.com/mobile/tegra/l4t/r16.5.0/ventana_release_armhf/Tegra20_Linux_R16.5_armhf.tbz2).
  Later versions of L4T probably contain even more modern versions of `nvflash`.

  Apparently the `BCT` ([Board Configuration Table](https://http.download.nvidia.com/tegra-public-appnotes/bct-overview.html)) is also to be found here at `bootloader/ventana/BCT/ventana_A03_12MHz_EDB8132B1PB6DF_300Mhz_1GB_emmc_THGBM1G6D4EBAI4.bct`.
- ASUS still publishes the stock firmware: [Eee Pad Transformer TF101 Firmware: V9.2.1.27 Only for WW SKU (Android 4.0.3)](https://www.asus.com/us/supportonly/eee%20pad%20transformer%20tf101/helpdesk_bios/)
  Yes, that's Android 4.0.3, _that's_ how old this device is.
- Some detail and tools from [AndroidRoot.Mobi](http://androidroot.github.io)
  - `wheelie` `0.2` from [AndroidRoot/wheelie](https://github.com/AndroidRoot/wheelie) (note most of the guides use `0.1`
    with a fundamentally different CLI.) 
  - `blobunpack` from [AndroidRoot/BlobTools](https://github.com/AndroidRoot/BlobTools)
- Crucially I needed the `flash.cfg` partition table and `BCT` blob from this post: https://xdaforums.com/t/asus-transformer-tf101-unbrick-instruction.3853989/ 
  fortunately the [google drive link to the package of files](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1UvXrWYfbp69qOWuKjOKoNV6DUDmD_er-) was not stale.
- Some inspiration from https://xdaforums.com/t/guide-official-unroot-guide-here.1093403/

So, to business.

Deep inside the ASUS firmware ZIP inside another ZIP is a file called `blob` which is the entire firmware 
[BLOB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_storage) to flash to the device's eMMC:
```shell
curl -JLO "https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/EeePAD/TF101/WW_epaduser9_2_1_27UpdateLauncher.zip?model=Eee%20Pad%20Transformer%20TF101"
unzip WW_epaduser9_2_1_27UpdateLauncher.zip WW_epad-user-9.2.1.27.zip
unzip WW_epad-user-9.2.1.27.zip blob
```

Build `blobunpack`:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/AndroidRoot/BlobTools
cd BlobTools
cmake .
make
cp bin/blobunpack ~/.local/bin/
cd -
``` 

Use `blobunpack` to extract the individual partition BLOBs from `blob`:
```shell
blobunpack blob
```

We now have blobs that match partitions found in...
- `blob.APP`
- `blob.EBT`
- `blob.LNX`
- `blob.SOS`

That `BCT` has its own blob, `transformer.bct` found in the "bigwheelie" package referenced above is different to the one
from the L4T archive (`bootloader/ventana/BCT/ventana_A03_12MHz_EDB8132B1PB6DF_300Mhz_1GB_emmc_THGBM1G6D4EBAI4.bct`. I used
`transformer.bct`. They're blobs so there's little information to be gleamed from `diff`'ing their `hexdumps`. [NVIDIA provides
a tool](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cbootimage) for generating these files, with the tantalising suggestion of a text-based 
format that can be compiled! But with nary a mention of the format nor an example. Apparently the source file is a
Device Tree Source file: https://github.com/grate-driver/linux/blob/master/arch/arm/boot/dts/tegra20-asus-tf101.dts.

Build `wheelie` (or use the `0.1` version from the "bigwheelie" package.)
```shell
git clone https://github.com/AndroidRoot/wheelie
cd wheelie
cmake .
make
cp bin/wheelie ~/.local/bin/
cd -
``` 

From here we need the TF101 in APX mode plugged in via it's proprietary USB cable. Reboot it into APX mode by holding 
down **Volume Up** and **Power** for a few seconds. The screen stay blank, there is no indication at all that the device 
is in APX mode. You can see the device with `lsusb` though:

> ```Bus 003 Device 006: ID 0955:7820 NVIDIA Corp. T20 [Tegra 2] recovery mode```

Interestingly in this mode it knows it is a Tegra 2 but not that it is a TF101. Compare to when it's connected when booted
to Android:

> ```Bus 003 Device 018: ID 0b05:4e0f ASUSTek Computer, Inc. Transformer TF101```

Use `wheelie` to _do some magic_ with `blob` so that the device will accept it.
```shell
wheelie --blob blob
```
I'm reasonably sure that this implies the bootloader and BCT are already included in `blob` and `wheelie` `0.2` is able 
to extract them itself.

Or, for `0.1` bundled in "bigwheelie":
```shell
./wheelie -2 --bl bootloader.bin --bct transformer.bct --odm `0x300d8011`
```

This particular TF101 is a SBK2 model, hence the `-2`. That ODM number is the T20/Ventana magic number; you can 
find them in L4T's `flash.sh`.

Grab `nvflash` from L4T and stick it on the `PATH`.

Use `nvflash` to _do some more magic_ to flash the individual partition BLOBs to their matching eMMC partitions.
```shell
nvflash -r --bct transformer.bct --setbct --configfile flash.cfg --create --odmdata 0x300d8011 --sync
```

It requires the `blob.*` files in the same directory, or update the `filename` paths in `flash.cfg`.

Wait for _ages_...

Ask it to continue booting normally:
```shell
nvflash -r --go
```
