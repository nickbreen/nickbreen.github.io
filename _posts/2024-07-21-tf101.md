Continuing on from [earlier](/2024/03/20/tf101.html) and still using [these tools](https://gitlab.com/antoni.aloytorrens/u-boot-tf101-tools.git)...

I know have a better idea of what's happening.

0. Boot the device in APX mode, it will now wait for a bootloader to be downloaded and executed...
1. `wheelie` has the SBK's compiled in, so it can:
   1. applies the device's BCT (Board Configuration Table)
   2. configures the magic ODM number
   3. encrypts the specified bootloader, downloads it to the device, and runs it.
2. that `bootloader.bin` runs and provides a "Nv3p" protocol server that `nvflash` can talk to.
3. `nvflash` can now do all sorts of stuff to the device!

So, [TWRP](https://twrp.me/asus/asustransformerTF101.html) is still a far superior recovery to ASUS' crappy recovery so let's install that.

0. Boot to APX (`Volume Up`+`Power`)
1. Run `wheelie` as usual:
   ```
   ./wheelie -2 --bl bootloader.bin --bct transformer.bct --odm 0x300d8011
   ```
2. unpack the partition from the blob
   ```
   blobunpack twrp-2.3.2.3-tf101.blob
   ```
3. download to the device's SOS partition (partition `5` in the default partition table) using `nvflash`
   ```
   ./nvflash -r --download 5 twrp-2.3.2.3-tf101.blob.SOS --sync
   ./nvflash -r --go
   ```
4. Reboot into TWRP (`Volume Down`+`Power`)

Nice, that means we can boot into TWRP and sideload or do anything we like.
