# Background

I needed to use `collectd` with its NUT plugin on RaspberryPi OS, this 
particular release did not have collectd's NUT plugin available.

The _next_ release of Raspberry Pi OS does include the NUT plugin as does 
(apparently) proposed updates; but how to use those versions of the package?

[APT Pinning][https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto] to the rescue, 
but it does recommend _not_ using pinning.

# Building a Package From Source

Instead it recommends you build the package from source: in this case the 
proposed updates source version enables the NUT plugin again, so we'll avoid 
any kind of multi-release nonsense and just build the package ourselves.

Because we're building the distribution's packages we could build them in /usr/src.
`apt source` will just download and extract the sources to the current directory.
So `cd` to where-ever you want to do this.

1. Enable sources: uncomment `deb-src` lines for your release in `/etc/apt/sources.list`:

        deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye main contrib non-free
        deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main contrib non-free
        deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye-updates main contrib non-free
        deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye main contrib non-free
        deb-src http://security.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main contrib non-free
        deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye-updates main contrib non-free
 
2. Update:

       apt update

3. Build:A

       apt -b source collectd

4. Install:

       dpkg -i collectd-core_5.12.0-7_arm64.deb

Easy!

_Except_, this built collectd-5.12.0-7, it does not contain the NUT plugin.

    dpkg --contents collectd-core_5.12.0-7_arm64.deb | grep usr/lib/collectd/nut.so

However a newer (distribution) version is available: 5.12.0-9 which does include 
the NUT plugin. Let's build that one instead.

1. Checkout the sources from source control:

       debcheckout collectd

2. Ensure build dependencies are available:

       apt build-dep collectd

3. Build:

       cd collectd/
       debuild -b -uc -us

4. Install:

       dpkg -i collectd-core_5.12.0-9_arm64.deb
