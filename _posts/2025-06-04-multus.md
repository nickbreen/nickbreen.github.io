title: Microk8s Multus CNI MACVLAN

I've had two itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server containers running on a single node
using docker-compose for a while now, but I wanted to move them to microk8s.

I wanted to have them announce themselves to the LAN so that the consoles could 
see them. This requires them to have a MACVLAN interface on the host's network.

This was "easy" to do with docker, I had a systemd service that also created the
"magic" MACVLAN network and the compose file attached the containers to it.

These are not complete files, only the relevant parts. 

```unit
# /etc/systemd/system/docker-compose-minecraft.service
[Service]
ExecStartPre=-/snap/bin/docker network create -d macvlan -o parent=enp4s0 --subnet 192.168.1.0/24 --ip-range 192.168.1.128/27 --gateway 192.168.1.1 magic
ExecStart=/snap/bin/docker compose up --abort-on-container-exit
```

```yaml
# docker-compose.yaml
networks:
  magic:
    external: true

services:
  minecraft:
    image: itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server
    networks:
      - magic
```

Converting this to kubernetes was not as straightforward as I had hoped. Mainly because working out what the magic 
JSON CNI configuration is was not obvious. I had to read the Multus CNI documentation and the 
[MACVLAN CNI](https://www.cni.dev/plugins/current/main/macvlan/) documentation.
Still, only needed an [arbitrary example](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni/blob/master/examples/macvlan-pod.yml) 
to fill in the gaps.

Helpfully, there is also a helm chart for itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server, so I didn't have to write a deployment myself.
So, exploiting helm's sub-chart dependency mechanism, I created a custom chart that creates the MACVLAN and assigns
it to the minecraft server(s).

```yaml
# Chart.yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: Minecraft
description: Minecraft
type: application
version: 0.0.0
appVersion: "0.0"
dependencies:
  - name: minecraft-bedrock
    version: 2.8.4
    repository: https://itzg.github.io/minecraft-server-charts/
```

```yaml
# values.yaml
minecraft-bedrock:
   podAnnotations:
      k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: macvlan
```

```yaml
# templates/macvlan.yaml
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
   name: macvlan
spec:
   config: |
      {
         "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
         "plugins": [
            {
               "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
               "type": "macvlan",
               "master": "enp4s0",
               "mode": "bridge",
               "ipam": {
                  "type": "host-local",
                  "ranges": [
                     [
                        {
                           "subnet": "192.168.1.0/24",
                           "gateway": "192.168.1.1",
                           "rangeStart": "192.168.1.129",
                           "rangeEnd": "192.168.1.159"
                        }
                     ]
                  ]
               }
            }
         ]
      }
```

Assuming one has already `microk8s enable multus`, the above files can be used to create a helm chart that will create 
the MACVLAN network and deploy the minecraft server(s) to it. I suspect that `master` and `mode` are redundant.

Crucially, the Multus CNI configuration _wraps_ the actual CNI MACVLAN _plugin_ configuration.

Every example I found online used the MACVLAN CNI configuration (without the Multus wrapper) and also specified the
`routes` and `dns` options. When spefifying the `routes` option all traffic fails inside the pod. Apparently because it
is the same subnet as the host's network and routing is confused.
