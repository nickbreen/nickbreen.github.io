I use [Bazel](https://bazel.build) professionally.

Sometimes it is _difficult_ to glean from the official documentation exactly how to do _some things_.

I've found that it's useful to attempt a trivial stand-alone project to solve whatever core question is at hand.

Here are three so far:

1.  [nickbreen/bz-platforms](http://github.com/nickbreen/bz-platforms) and [nickbreen/bz-platforms2](http://github.com/nickbreen/bz-platforms2)

    Targeting and executing on different [Platforms](https://bazel.build/extending/platforms).

2.  [nickbreen/bz-docker](http://github.com/nickbreen/bz-docker)
      
    Building container images.

3.  [nickbreen/bz-airgap](http://github.com/nickbreen/bz-airgap)
    
    Getting all dependencies required for your builds for use when the internet is not available; i.e. air-gapped CI environments.

4.  [nickbreen/bz-python](http://github.com/nickbreen/bz-python)

    Building an old version of python to use as a toolchain.

5.  [nickbreen/bes](http://github.com/nickbreen/bes) 
    
    Build Event Service: cram Bazel's Build Event Protocol stream into a DB.
